            <h2>Corpus Analysis: “Oh Love! What Is It in This World of Ours”</h2>
            <p>
                This section explores my digital text analysis of the poetic dialogue between Julian and Elphina using Voyant Tools. 
                The goal was to uncover word frequency patterns and emotional themes in the text.

            <h3>Analysis and Interpretation</h3>
            <p>
                The Voyant Tools Cirrus word cloud reveals that the most frequent words are 
                <strong>“Elphina,” “Julian,” “love,” “heart,”</strong> and <strong>“fate.”</strong> 
                These terms highlight the emotional center of the text — a tragic love story between two characters. 
                The repetition of “Elphina” emphasizes her emotional presence, while “love” and “heart” reflect the intimate tone of their dialogue.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The <strong>Trends graph</strong> shows variations in word frequency across the text. Words like “love” and “heart” peak at moments of affection, 
                while “fate” and “sigh” appear when Julian predicts their parting. This contrast between emotional connection and inevitability of loss mirrors 
                the Romantic era’s focus on passion and tragedy.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Compare and Contrast</h3>
            <p>
                When compared to other corpora, such as <strong>U.S. presidential speeches</strong> or <strong>modern fiction</strong>, 
                this text stands out for its heavy use of emotional and poetic vocabulary. 
                Political speeches often focus on words like “nation,” “freedom,” and “future,” expressing collective purpose rather than personal emotion. 
                In contrast, “Oh Love!” explores inner turmoil, intimacy, and destiny — showing how language reflects not only topic but also intent: 
                one seeks unity through logic, the other through feeling.
            </p>

            <p>
                This visual and linguistic comparison shows that the <em>“Oh Love”</em> corpus is emotionally charged and introspective, 
                while public discourse texts tend to focus on rational or societal ideals. Together, they reveal how word frequency and tone 
                reflect the purpose of each genre.
