            <h2>Story Summary</h2>
            <p>
                In <strong>Delivery Quest</strong>, you play as a courier starting out in a small 
                <strong>Starting Village</strong>. Your job is to pick up important packages and 
                deliver them safely across different areas, from quiet paths to dangerous routes. 
                As you travel, you deal with enemies, tricky terrain, and time pressure while trying 
                to finish your deliveries at the <strong>Final Delivery Hub</strong>.
            </p>

            <h2>Game World & Level Structure</h2>
            <p>
                The world is divided into multiple areas linked by the delivery routes. You begin in the 
                <strong>Starting Village</strong> (home of the Quest Giver and Delivery NPCs), then travel 
                through the <strong>Forest Trail</strong>, reach the <strong>City Market</strong>, climb the 
                <strong>Mountain Pass</strong>, and finally arrive at the 
                <strong>Final Delivery Hub</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also collect <strong>Key Items</strong> and use <strong>Power-ups</strong> for temporary boosts.

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    <em>Art of Fighting 2</em> is a 1994 Neo Geo fighting game set in South Town,
                    a gritty, crime-ridden city where martial artists face off in brutal
                    tournaments and personal rivalries. I played the game in emulated form,
                    controlling Ryo Sakazaki as I fought through a ladder of opponents. This
                    review looks at the game world, its characters, its objects and systems,
                    the challenge it offers, and a network visualization I built in Kumu to show
                    how everything connects.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Game World and Setting</h2>
                <p>
                    The world of <em>Art of Fighting 2</em> is centered on South Town, a
                    dangerous city that feels controlled by crime and underground power.
                    Each stage is a different piece of this world: alleyways, dojos, bars,
                    rooftops, and arenas. The artists used detailed 2D sprite graphics to
                    build these spaces, with bright colors, signs, and small background
                    animations that make South Town feel alive. During special attacks,
                    the game cuts to close-up facial portraits that react to damage, which
                    makes the fights feel personal and dramatic. The horizon of the game
                    world is not a giant open map, but a series of carefully designed
                    locations that all communicate the same feeling: this city is rough,
                    stylish, and ruled by fighting.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Sound and music also help build the world. The soundtrack uses
                    high-energy arcade themes that match each stage’s mood, from tense
                    rival battles to boss fights. Punches, kicks, and special moves have
                    sharp impact sounds, and voice samples shout moves and reactions. Together,
                    the graphics and audio make South Town feel like a classic 90s arcade
                    world where your whole focus is on intense one-on-one combat.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Characters You Control and Meet</h2>
                <p>
                    I mainly played as Ryo Sakazaki, a disciplined Kyokugen Karate fighter
                    who is balanced in offense and defense. His iconic Haoh Shokoken projectile
                    and strong basics make him a good character for learning the game. You get
                    to know Ryo through his stance, his animations, and his role in the story
                    as a serious martial artist fighting to protect his family and dojo.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The opponents are not just random enemies; they are characters with clear
                    fighting identities. Robert Garcia is Ryo’s stylish rival, using long,
                    flowing kicks and confident posture. King mixes elegance and power, using
                    technical strikes and good spacing. Yuri Sakazaki is Ryo’s sister, who
                    fights with playful energy but real strength. The hidden boss, Geese
                    Howard, feels like the true power behind South Town, with punishing
                    counters and a calm, threatening presence. Each character looks, moves,
                    and fights differently, so you are constantly adjusting your style as you
                    move through the roster.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Objects, Systems, and Interactions</h2>
                <p>
                    Unlike an RPG, <em>Art of Fighting 2</em> does not focus on picking up
                    lots of objects. Instead, it uses a few important systems that act like
                    invisible “objects” you always interact with. The most important of these
                    is the spirit gauge, which limits how often you can use special moves.
                    When your spirit gauge is full, your fireballs and uppercuts come out
                    fast and strong. If you overuse them, the gauge empties and your specials
                    become weaker or fail. This forces you to think carefully about when to
                    spend your energy and when to recover it.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    You also interact with the health bar, the round timer, and the combo
                    system. These systems encourage smart blocking, spacing, and counter-attacks
                    instead of random button mashing. Even though there are not many physical
                    items on the screen, the game is full of interactive elements that control
                    what you can do and reward good timing and planning.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Challenge and Gameplay</h2>
                <p>
                    As a player, you are constantly challenged on several levels at once:
                    execution, strategy, and patience. The CPU opponents can be very
                    aggressive, and they punish bad habits. Managing the spirit gauge while
                    timing special moves is demanding, because you must watch both your own
                    resources and your opponent’s behavior. Early fights teach you basic
                    spacing and blocking, but the later stages push you to read patterns and
                    adapt quickly.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Boss fights, especially against Geese Howard, are where the challenge
                    spikes. Geese waits for your mistakes and then punishes with big damage.
                    Winning these fights requires precise blocking, safe movement, and
                    carefully chosen moments to spend spirit on specials. The game can feel
                    frustrating when you lose repeatedly, but winning a hard match is very
                    satisfying, because you know you improved your skill and not just your
                    luck.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Network Visualization in Kumu</h2>
                <p>
                    To help explain how the game is structured, I built a network
                    visualization in Kumu. In my network, the nodes represent fighters like
                    Ryo, Robert, King, Yuri, and Geese, as well as South Town, the spirit
                    gauge, the combo system, and the tournament ladder. The connections
                    describe how these elements relate: who fights who, where fights take
                    place, and which systems influence gameplay. For example, Ryo connects
                    to each rival through “fights” links, and he connects to the spirit gauge
                    through a “uses” link, because his ability to win depends on managing that
                    system.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Someone who has never played <em>Art of Fighting 2</em> can click through
                    the network and see that the game is not just random fights. It is a
                    structured world made of characters, locations, and rules that all connect
                    to each other. The network gives an overview of the game’s design in a
                    way that is hard to see just from screenshots.
                </p>

                <h2>Reflection and Possible Improvements</h2>
                <p>
                    As an art form, <em>Art of Fighting 2</em> captures a certain 1990s idea
                    of toughness, rivalry, and skill. The game world shows a city ruled by
                    strength and reputation, and the mechanics demand discipline from the
                    player. In a way, it reflects real-world competitive culture, where people
                    are judged by performance and control under pressure. The game is also a
                    good example of how limited hardware can still create a rich world through
                    strong art direction and clever systems.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    If the developers revisited this game today, I think smoother difficulty
                    and better tutorials for new players would improve it. A training mode
                    that clearly explains the spirit gauge, combos, and defensive options
                    would make the game more accessible without removing the challenge. Even
                    with its age and difficulty spikes, though, <em>Art of Fighting 2</em>
                    is still worth exploring, especially for players interested in classic
                    fighting games and how game systems can shape a complete, immersive world.
