            <h2>Story Summary</h2>
            <p>
                In <strong>Delivery Quest</strong>, you play as a courier starting out in a small 
                <strong>Starting Village</strong>. Your job is to pick up important packages and 
                deliver them safely across different areas, from quiet paths to dangerous routes. 
                As you travel, you deal with enemies, tricky terrain, and time pressure while trying 
                to finish your deliveries at the <strong>Final Delivery Hub</strong>.
            </p>

            <h2>Game World & Level Structure</h2>
            <p>
                The world is divided into multiple areas linked by the delivery routes. You begin in the 
                <strong>Starting Village</strong> (home of the Quest Giver and Delivery NPCs), then travel 
                through the <strong>Forest Trail</strong>, reach the <strong>City Market</strong>, climb the 
                <strong>Mountain Pass</strong>, and finally arrive at the 
                <strong>Final Delivery Hub</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also collect <strong>Key Items</strong> and use <strong>Power-ups</strong> for temporary boosts.

            <h2>What Works Well</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The delivery route creates a strong sense of adventure.</li>
                <li>Locations feel different: village → trail → market → mountain.</li>
                <li>Enemies and power-ups add strategy and tension.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Ideas for Improvement</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Add more enemy types or smarter AI.</li>
                <li>Include optional side quests or timed deliveries.</li>
                <li>More dramatic feedback when a package is stolen or delivered.</li>
