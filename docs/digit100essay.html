            <h2>my web xp</h2>
            <p>When I made a website using HTML and CSS, one of the best parts was being in control of everything. I could decide how the text, pictures, and links looked, and I could put things exactly where I wanted. It was really fun to add pictures of myself and even include captions under them. I liked that my website ended up looking just how I imagined it. I got to choose the colors, fonts, and layout, which made the whole project feel really personal. The hard part was that it took a lot of time to write all the code and make sure everything worked correctly. Sometimes I couldn’t figure out why something wasn’t working, and it could be pretty frustrating.

GitHub gives you a lot of creative freedom because you can try new ideas without worrying about breaking your project. You can save different versions, go back if something doesn’t work, and even share your work with other people. It also made my projects feel more organized and professional. Honestly, GitHub is kind of “woke” — once you learn it, it’s super exciting to experiment, improve, and see your code evolve. Learning it felt like unlocking a whole new level of creativity in coding.
                
                In the future, I want to keep improving my web design skills by learning more advanced HTML and CSS techniques, like creating responsive layouts that look good on phones and computers. I’d also like to learn some JavaScript so I can add animations or interactive features to my pages. The more I understand how all the pieces of a website fit together, the more I can express my ideas online. This project showed me that coding isn’t just about typing lines of text — it’s a way to be creative and build something that’s completely my own.
