            <h2>my web xp</h2>
            <p>
            When I created a website using HTML and CSS, one of the best parts was my ability to be in control of everything. 
            I could decide how the text, pictures, and links would look on the web page and where they would get styled. 
            It was even fun to be able to add images of me, and the fact that I could place them just how I wanted and 
            even put captions under the images made it even more enjoyable. I found it very cool that my website ended 
            up looking how I wanted it. On the other hand, it took a lot of time to write all the code and ensure all the 
            links, photos, and text were working correctly. Sometimes it would take me a while to figure out why something 
            wasn't working, and I would be a little upset when I would make mistakes.
