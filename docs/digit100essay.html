            <h2>my web xp</h2>
            <p>When I made a website using HTML and CSS, one of the best parts was being in control of everything. I could decide how the text, pictures, and links looked, and I could put things exactly where I wanted. It was really fun to add pictures of me and even put captions under them. I liked that my website ended up looking just how I imagined it. I could choose the colors, fonts, and layouts, which made the whole project feel really personal. The hard part was that it took a lot of time to write all the code and make sure everything worked right. Sometimes I couldn’t figure out why something wasn’t working, and it could be pretty frustrating. Even small mistakes, like a missing bracket or a broken link, could mess up the whole page, but fixing them taught me a lot about attention to detail.
                
                Using GitHub made things even cooler. At first, it’s a little complicated and confusing, and I wasn’t sure how everything worked. But once I understood it, it became way more fun and way more powerful. GitHub gives you a lot of creative freedom because you can try new ideas without worrying about breaking your project. You can save different versions, go back if something doesn’t work, and even share your work with other people. It also made my projects more organized and professional. Honestly, GitHub is kind of “woke” because once you know how to use it, it’s really exciting to experiment, improve, and see your code grow. Learning it felt like unlocking a whole new level of creativity in coding.
